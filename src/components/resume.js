              I am a highly motivated software engineer who is looking to move
              out of my current technical consulting role and into a full-time
              developer position. In my professional career, developing custom
              solutions for marketer’s needs has allowed me to work with many
              types of technologies within the martech industry. I have a strong
              passion for technology and am always looking for opportunities to
              supplement my learning through personal projects and multiple
              online learning resources that I am continuously engaging in.{" "}
